<!-- badges: end -->

A package (of my) Rprofile customisations. The goal is it broaden the package
to be of use to other people.

## Installation


You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("csgillespie/rprofile")
```

The package also uses two non-cran packages

``` r
gaborcsardi/prompt,
jalvesaq/colorout
```


## Setting better options

The `set_startup_options()` function sets better (in my opinion) set of start-up options.
These include

 * Setting `Ncpus` to run parallel installs by default
 * Removing significant stars
 * Reduce the default print length
 * Plus a few others

I've also created a convenience function for adding additional R repositories - `set_repos()`.
Probably not needed by most people.

## R prompt

The R prompt has also been customised (using the __prompt__ package):

 * If you are in a Git repo, the branch will be displayed.
 * If R's memory becomes large, the size will be displayed.
 
A distinction needs to be made between the RStudio Console and the terminal. The console
already has lots of nice features, e.g. syntax highlighting. So I have two 
separated functions.
 
## Useful start-up messages

Currently two start-up messages are displayed:

 * The wifi network you are connected too with speed info
 * The number of open R sessions
 
This currently only works under Linux.

## Helper functions

It's always dangerous to load functions in your start-up script, so I've only included
functions I'm fairly sure won't be used in a script.

 * `create_make_functions()` - if you have a `Makefile` in your working directory, this will
 automatically generate all associated make functions. For example, if you have a `force` argument in the `Makefile` this will generate `make_force()`
 
 * `lsos()` - a handy function for listing large objects
 
 * `op(path = ".")` - Creates & opens an RStudio project in the the directory specified
 
 * `cp()` - Lists previous RStudio projects and gives an option to open.
 
 * `library()` - Over writes the `library()` function with a smarter version. If a package
 is missing, automatically provides the option to install from CRAN or GitHub
 
 * `last_error()` and `last_trace()` - pre-loads from __rlang__. Nicer error investigation

## Example `.Rprofile`

Open your `.Rprofile`, e.g. `file.edit("~/.Rprofile")` and customise however you want.
Here's an example

```
if (interactive() && requireNamespace("rprofile", quietly = TRUE)) {

  # Only useful if you use Makefiles
  rprofile::create_make_functions()
  
  # Startup options
  rprofile::set_startup_options()
  
  # Not RStudio console
  if (rprofile::is_terminal()) {
    rprofile::set_terminal()
  } else {
    rprofile::set_rstudio()
  }

  .env = rprofile::get_functions()
  attach(.env)
  # Display wifi and no of R sessiones
  rprofile::startup_info()
}
```

## Notes

 * The `lsos()` function was taken from the [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/q/1358003/203420) 
 question.
 
 * The improved version of \code{library()} was adapted from the 
 [autoinst](https://github.com/jimhester/autoinst/). I did think about importing the package, 
 but I had made too many personal tweaks.
 
 * Setting the prompt uses the excellent [prompt](https://github.com/gaborcsardi/prompt) 
 package.
 
 * I've probably "borrowed" some of the other ideas from blogposts and SO questions. If I've missed crediting you, please let me know and I'll rectify it.
